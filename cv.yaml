about: 
  I'm a 1st year Ph.D. student in \href{https://www.avestimehr.com/}{<b>Prof. Salman Avestimehr</b>}'s vITAL Lab at <b>University of Southern California (USC)</b> in Los Angeles .
  I study foundational topics and applications in <b>federated learning</b>, <b>graph neural networks</b>, <b>probabilistic deep learning</b>(focused on stochastic variational inference), and <b>information theory</b> . In my research, I seek to design learning algorithms that can cope with non I.I.D. nature of real-life data in federated setting. I try to actively contribute to \href{https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML}{FedML}, a promising research library for federated learning
  as I believe that federated learning systems should be accessible everyone.
  
  During my masters, I was an  R\&D Engineer at Turkcell Technology under my master's advisor, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/ergut/}{<b>Dr. Salih Ergut</b>}, thanks to the 5G & Beyond Graduate Scholarship.
